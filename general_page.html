        <span class="title">What is KindMeal?</span>
        <p>
          KindMeal is Malaysia's (and possibly the world's!) pioneering
          meat-free lifestyle platform. We provide an effective platform to
          promote compassionate dining in a fun and effective way, that would
          allow you to save precious animal lives, improve your health, enjoy a
          cleaner environment and of course, save your hard-earned money.
        </p>

        <span class="title">What is Meat-Free?</span>
        <p>
          Meat-free means that the food does not contain any meat, or
          ingredients derived from meat. However, it may contain some elements
          that people of certain diet do not consume, such as eggs, dairy /
          milk, or alcohol. Please refer to the details within each specific
          shop / deal for further information.
        </p>

        <span class="title">How do I sign up to KindMeal? Is it free?</span>

          Yes, it is absolutely free. To join our community of food lovers and
          grab awesome deals, please <a href="#">sign up here.</a> <br /><br />

        <span class="title">What is a Username?</span>
        <p>
          A Username is a nickname exclusively used to identify your profile. It
          will be used to access your Public Page, such as
          https://KindMeal.my/MyUsername, and it will also be displayed when you
          share KindMoments, comments and reviews.
        </p>

        <span class="title">How do KindMeal deals work?</span>
        <p>
          Restaurants create attractive deals within KindMeal, which you can
          obtain coupons for. Our coupons differ from other conventional deal
          sites in that you do not need to make any upfront payment at KindMeal,
          and you can easily present our LiveCoupon via computer, mobile or
          laptop without any print coupons. For restaurants that do not require
          advance reservations, you can even use the LiveCoupon immediately!
          After all, eating is an impulsive decision, right?
        </p>

        <span class="title">How do I get a KindMeal coupon?</span>
        <p>
          Just browse to a deal you like, select the corresponding outlet
          location (if the restaurant has multiple locations), then click on Get
          Coupon. Please note that the outlet location cannot be changed after
          the coupon is obtained. <br /><br />
          Each member is limited to 5 active coupons only. You must use the
          coupons before you can obtain additional ones. Unused coupons will
          automatically expire upon reaching its due date.
        </p>

        <span class="title">What is KindWords?</span>
        <p>
            KindWords is a great way to tell your friends about the great food and instantly get more discount.
            <br><br>
            For deals with KindWords enabled, you can enjoy DOUBLE the discount if you share the deal on Facebook or Twitter. Once you successfully share it, you will immediately receive the exclusive discount for your deal. If you prefer not to take advantage of KindWords, you can still proceed to get the deal at the normal discount price. Please note that not all deals support KindWords - it depends on the merchant.
        </p>

        <span class="title">How do I use my KindMeal LiveCoupon?</span>
        <p>
            Once a coupon is received, you can access the LiveCoupon and use it via one of the following ways. An Internet connection is required.
            <br><br>
                <ul class="list">
                    <li>At KindMeal website, under Account -> My Coupons section</li>
                    <li>With our KindMeal mobile app, under Deals -> My Coupons section</li>
                 </ul>
        <p>
            You should only activate the LiveCoupon when you are at the restaurant, and upon informing the merchant. Some merchants may require that you activate it during the ordering process, while some will be during the payment process. Please inform the merchant first when you are ordering to ensure they are aware of your KindMeal LiveCoupon.
            <br><br>
            Once an active LiveCoupon is loaded, you will see a timer counting down the time remaining to use it. To activate it, click on Use LiveCoupon. Please ensure that you only activate it upon the request of the merchant. <b>Activating it ahead of time may void your coupon and deal.</b> 
        </p>
            
        </p>

        <span class="title">What if I don't have a mobile device or Internet connection, can I use a Print Coupon?</span>
        <p>
            This depends on the specific deal. If the merchant allows it, you can also choose to print out the coupon and bring it along. Please refer to the deal's Terms & Conditions to check if print coupons are allowed, and if any prior reservation and usage delay are required.
            <br><br>
            To print your coupon, first access it via KindMeal website at the Account->Account -> My Coupons section, then click on Print Coupon at the corresponding coupon. If the Print Coupon button is not available, it means that only LiveCoupons are accepted for the deal.
        </p>

        <span class="title">What is a Print Coupon's Usage Delay?</span>
        <p> 
            Some merchants may not have the facilities available to verify Print Coupons instantly, so they may impose a Usage Delay of a certain number of days to first print out a cross-checking reference list. If there is a 3-Day delay, it means that you can only use the Print Coupon 3 days after obtaining the coupon.
            <br><br>
            You may wish to check with the merchant first before using it. We strongly suggest using a LiveCoupon instead, which is immediate with no usage delays.
        </p>

        <span class="title">How do I create a shop and offer deals?</span>
        <p>
            You need to first sign up a merchant account. If you have an existing food lover account, we can upgrade it for you to enable the Merchant functions. To do so, please contact us and tell us more about your shop.
            <br><br>
            Once your merchant account is activated, you can find out more details at the Merchant Help section.
